AssetBundleSetting for Unity 5.x
================================

A tool which provides a simple editor setting to build assetbundles especially Unity5.x version.


![ setting](./Images/setting.png "setting")


It provides various assetbundle options regardless of Unity's minor version and makes it easy to build assetbundles. 
If the version of Unity is 5.3.x, it provides *'ChunkBasedCompression'* option which is newly added on Unity 5.3.x.


Usage
-----

* Select 'Tools/AssetBundles/Create Build Setting' menu item.
* Set assetbundle options.
* Set output directory where the created bundles are placed.
* Build!


Known Issues
------------
* Highly recommended to use with Unity 5.x.
* It does not contain any script to load assetbundles, See [an asset bundle demo for Unity5 on bitbucket site](https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/assetbundledemo) or other stuff for that.
* Not support build target platform specific setting at the moment.
